# CookieCutter PythonTK

An extremely bare bones cookiecutter template for python projects that are quick TK based GUI analysis scripts.

The original cookiecutter project can be found:

[cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)

## Using CookieCutter for your project

    $ pip install cookiecutter
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/gjcooper/cookiecutter-pythonTK

The setup script will ask you some basic information including name and email address which will then be used in your new project.

## Purpose

The purpose here is to streamline the setup of a bare bones python project (TK based). It is super minimalistic, ignoring documentation other than a Readme.
